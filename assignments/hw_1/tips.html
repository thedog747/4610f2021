			<h2>Misc. Tips</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Passive Arrow Charge</dt>
				<dd>You can queue charged arrow shots while moving and attacking. This will allow you to eek out more damage while waiting for the bow's charge to fill. The charge is interrupted by various actions like rolling and using items, so be cognizant of that while attempting this strategy.</dd>
				<dt>Nonlinear Progression</dt>
				<dd>There are four crest fragments that must be obtained to open the door to Royal Pinacotheca. Three are found directly after beating a boss, while the remaining fragment is only obtainable using an ability granted by defeating a boss. These can be received in any order, which is very useful in repeat playthroughs.</dd>
				<dt>Damageless Reward</dt>
				<dd>If you can beat a boss without taking damage, you will receive a special item that cannot be obtained otherwise. It's a hard challenge, but the items are very powerful and may help with future bosses.</dd>
				<dt>Karst Castle Sequence Break</dt>
				<dd>There is an interior in Karst Castle with only a shrine and a blockade. Out of view, there lies a lever above that cannot be reached. If you obtained the Bakman Patch by beating Moka and Lubella without taking damage, you can use it to hit the off-screen lever and skip part of the castle.</dd>

			<h1>Tips for Playing</h1>
			<p>This section will be a rundown of the most useful things your character is capable of.</p>
			<h2>Roll</h2>
			<img src="images/momoroll.png" alt="Roll">
			<p>This could be called your most important move. The main fun in the gameplay, in my opinion, comes from how you move around, and for higher levels of play, mastering the roll is essential.</p>
			<p>When you roll, not only does it move you past anything in your way, but you also dodge any attack coming your way for a short time. The frames in which you are invulnerable are usually referred to as i-frames. Leading attacks on and off of rolls will let your battles truly flow.</p>
			<h2>First Jab</h2>
			<img src="images/momojab1.png" alt="First Jab">
			<p>Your jab is a quick strike meant to make contact, but not intended as any sort of great blow to the opponent.</p>
			<p>It's main purpose is as a means of chipping away at the enemy, primarily by hitting them at the end of an attack or before a roll.</p>
			<p>Don't be too hasty. Trying to get a cheap jab on the enemy before your escape can work, but your timing must be perfect.</p>
			<h2>Second Jab</h2>
			<img src="images/momojab2.png" alt="Second Jab">
			<p>The second jab follows similarly to the first one, but is extremely useful against certain bosses. The two jab smack combo is very effective at breaking poise.</p>
			<p>Poise is a system where an enemy will take damage as normal until a hidden meter runs out, leaving them staggered. After a short while the boss will stop getting staggered and its poise will recover in full. One must effectively break poise and let it recover in a cycle to quickly beat bosses.</p>
			<p>In the fight with Lupiar, you can break her poise and then roll out of the way before Magnolia bombards you with her arrows.</p>
			<h2>Heavy Attack</h2>
			<img src="images/momoheavy.png" alt="Heavy Attack">
			<p>This attack does more damage than the aforementioned jabs. It comes after the two attacks, leading nicely off of the poise break.</p>
			<p>The animation takes a long time to execute, though, so you are left open towards the end of it. Know what your enemy is doing and what the timings of your attacks are, and you can utilize this attack properly.</p>
			<p>If you want to spam stronger attacks, I don't recommend this one. Try the Air Attack instead.</p>
			<h2>Air Attack</h2>
			<img src="images/momosmack.png" alt="Air Attack">
			<p>An attack just about as strong as the heavy attack, but this one can be activated by attacking in midair. It requires no jabs to execute.</p>
			<p>However, the recovery on this attack is even more precarious than the heavy attack, as you are in the air and, therefore, cannot dodge unless you are using the air-dash crest fragment.</p>
			<p>A great attack to spam, when the time is right. When done correctly, a series of jump and attack inputs can be turned into a spamfest of strong attacks.</p>
