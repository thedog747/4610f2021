			<dl>
				<dt>Baukman Patch</dt>
				<dd>Sends a torrent of Bak Blocks from the sky to smack down enemies. Very effective at quickly breaking poise.</dd>
				<dt>Tainted Missive</dt>
				<dd>Gives you a temporary damage buff, but also lowers your health by 1/4. You can use it to intentionally reduce your health down to 1/4 of its maximum for synergy with the Necklace of Sacrifice.</dd>
				<dt>Necklace of Sacrifice</dt>
				<dd>At 1/4 of your maximum health you will do greatly increased damage. With the right items, this can be used to quicky dispatch most bosses.</dd>
				<dt>Sparse Thread</dt>
				<dd>Generates a powerful AOE attack on use. Press the item key and say goodbye to the enemy's health.</dd>

			<h1>Exploits</h1>
			<p>Here's a few things that might be of use to a more utilitarian player.</p>
			<h2>Jump Roll</h2>
			<img src="images/rollingjump.png" alt="Rolling Jump">
			<p>If you execute a frame perfect action where you press the jump and roll buttons at the same time, your character will jump and roll at the same time.</p>
			<p>This can be useful in speedrunning, where a faster time can be achieved by continuously rolling, but you must cross gaps or ledges.</p>
			<p>Aside from that, it's just fun. It looks cool, you go flying and tumbling through the air, and it's a great time.</p>
			<p>If you wanna show off your tech skill, just do one of these during a boss fight</p>
			<p>I've used this to get past that shield imp in the first area without any issue. I've also used it to dodge things in midair, even chaining it into the air-dash.</p>
			<p>Having a good keyboard is recommended for this, as the inputs must be exact. If it suits you, invest in a controller instead.</p>
			<h2>Jump Jab</h2>
			<img src="images/jabjump.png" alt="Jab Jump">
			<p>This move follows the same principle as the Jump Roll. To execute it you must press the jump button and the attack button on the exact same frame.</p>
			<p>Keep in mind, this is not the same as an air attack. This is an exploit that allows you to use your normal ground jab in midair. It isn't nearly as strong, but can be executed much quicker.</p>
			<p>Intriguing as it is, I haven't found many uses for this exploit.</p>
			<p>The only cool thing you may be able to do with it is execute this attack, then follow up with a standard Air Attack. This may be enough to break an opponent's poise.</p>
			<p>It can do an alright job at hitting enemies on a ledge with great speed.</p>
			<p>Don't count on this one. It's just a general oddity that I found during my time playing the game.</p>
			<h2>Roll Skip</h2>
			<img src="images/rollskip.png" alt="Roll Skip">
			<p>The roll skip is a method you can do to close more of the distance between you and certain bosses before the fight begins.</p>
			<p>You may have learned something similar before, an intended feature, that lets you skip a boss cutscene by entering and leaving your menu. This expands upon that.</p>
			<p>To do this, stand right before the trigger zone of the boss battle. A few frames before you enter it, press the roll button. In doing this, your character will complete their animation, rolling further past the trigger zone than usual.</p>
			<p>I've not found too many uses for this, but I found it to be somewhat helpful against the boss Pardoner Fennel.</p>
