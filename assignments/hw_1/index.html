			<h1>Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight</h1>
			<p>Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an indie Metroidvania style video game developed by Bombservice and published by Playism. The game was originally released on March 4, 2016 for Microsoft Windows. It is the fourth installment of the Momodora series that began in 2010 with Momodora I. If you liked Metroid, Castlevania, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, or similar games, you're gonna love Momodora: RuTM.</p>
			<h2>True Challenge</h2>
			<img src="images/pray.png" alt="New players will spend a lot of time here.">
			<p>Even on normal settings, Momodora can be a difficult game. That is not to say this difficulty cannot be overcome, but that there will be some learning involved, for novices and veterans alike. At earlier stages, knowledge of the game's secret items and locations may help you in your playthrough, allowing the rest of the game to be completed much easier.</p>
			<p>Soon, a player might try completing challenge runs. It is here that the game increases exponentially in difficulty, and knowledge of poise mechanics, hitboxes, and attack patterns become essential to victory. This website will help you face the game with greater ease, both beginners and the seasoned alike.</p>
